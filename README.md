## Task 1 : Plot Barchart or Histogram to visualize continuous variable.

Problem Statement:

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in population.

About Dataset

In this project the dataset we are using is World Development Indicators Dataset 2001 - 2022. The given Data Frame contains information about various indicators for different countries. It has 266 rows and 26 columns.

## Tools Utilized:
   <ul>
   Python<br />
   Jupyter Notebook<br />
   MatPlotLib
   </ul>
   
## Task Requirements:

Age Distribution Analysis:<br />  
  1.Import the Matplotlib library.<br /><br /> 
  2. Utilize provided data for age distribution in the world population.<br />  
  3. Create a bar chart to represent the age distribution. <br /> 
  4. Display the generated bar chart.<br />  
  5. Gender Distribution Analysis<br />  
  6. Use the provided data for gender distribution in the world population.<br />  
  7. Generate a histogram to visualize the gender distribution.<br />  
  8. Display the histogram.

## Conclusion:
<br />
This data science project provides a foundational understanding of age and gender distributions in the world population through visualizations created using Python and Matplotlib. Further analysis and exploration can be conducted to gain deeper insights into demographic patterns.
